                    </div>
                    <p>We were tasked to redesign a local business' website and condense the information to a single
                        page. Links, apart from social media, could not lead to another pag, however, anchor tags to IDs
                        on the page were allowed.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container col-md-8 project__row--main">
                    <div class="project__image--large">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Project_01_01.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <div class="project__number project__number--one">

                        <h3>Content Audit</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the content auditing process I had to decide which information was needed or could still
                            be
                            relevant even after condensing in to a one page format.
                            With a brewery it was obvious that the beer was what needed to focused on. So I began
                            looking at accordian layouts and researching what type of layout I could achieve. Their
                            brewery membership pricing and information was put onto a pdf so I needed to display the key
                            points.

                            <br>
                            Another feature of the site was the ability to book their Taproom space, which could be
                            condensed. While they had
                            separate pages for corporate and private events, they were the exact same form.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project__number project__number--two">

                        <h3>UI Discovery</h3>
                        <p>
                            My focus was almost entirely on the beer selection. I had to make sure the information that
                            they decided was important regarding their product was evident while also keeping to one
                            page. The information they had (ABV, IBU, Beer Type etc.) were all necessary and couldn't
                            neceessarily be left out.

                            <br>
                            Because of the extensive information on the page, there needed to be a way to navigate the
                            entirety of the page easily.
                            I chose to create a fixed navbar on the side of the page that would contain anchor tags that
                            would take you the specific sections of the site on the page.





                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="project__number project__number--three">

                        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            The website and its products, in this case the cans, had a disconnect in visual identity. So
                            I began to draw from the industrial motifs of the cans and apply that to the website itself.
                            Which proved to be reward because there was a cohesiveness to the UI elements now.

                            <h4>Accordian</h4>

                            <p>My crown jewel of the project was indeed the accordian I chose to have tabs that would
                                toggle between their seasonal and core batches.
                                I designed icons that would denote whether it was available as a keg, in the taproom or
                                in case. IBV and ABV are included at the bottom using their bar graphic but updated to
                                the identity I implemented in this iteration. </p>
